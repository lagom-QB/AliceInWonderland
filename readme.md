# Data is Plural Challenge

ðŸ“š The goal is to explore literary dialogue with the Data Is Plural visualization challenge, featuring the Project Dialogism Novel Corpus.

---
In this project, I use python to analyze and visualize text from [Alice In Wonderland](https://github.com/Priya22/project-dialogism-novel-corpus/tree/b670b9a3359438a1dcf9f9516321d801f283749e/data/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland) by _Lewis Carol_, exploring the text to determine these __KPIs__:

- Which words appear most frequently #âœ…
- Who are the main characters in the novel? #âœ…
- How are the characters related?
- Who makes the most speaches #âœ…
- Who are the speeches to? #âœ…
- What are the speeches in reference to? #âœ…
- ... other basic statistics about the lengths of sentences and paragraphs in the text.

The data folder contains 3 files:

- [Information on characters](https://github.com/Priya22/project-dialogism-novel-corpus/blob/b670b9a3359438a1dcf9f9516321d801f283749e/data/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland/character_info.csv)
- [Novel text](https://github.com/Priya22/project-dialogism-novel-corpus/blob/b670b9a3359438a1dcf9f9516321d801f283749e/data/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland/novel_text.txt)
- [Quotations](https://github.com/Priya22/project-dialogism-novel-corpus/blob/b670b9a3359438a1dcf9f9516321d801f283749e/data/AlicesAdventuresInWonderland/quotation_info.csv)
